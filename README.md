# AquilX_DataVisualizationProject

This project is a personal data analysis and visualization tool built to explore and visualize patient health indicators from the [Kaggle Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset). It focuses on comparing biometric data (e.g., Age, BMI) with binary health outcomes like high glucose status.  
This was developed as a skills project to demonstrate Python programming, data cleaning, and data visualization techniques.
