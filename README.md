# AquilX_DataVisualizationProject

This project is a personal data analysis and visualization tool built to explore and visualize patient health indicators from the [Kaggle Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset). It focuses on comparing biometric data (e.g., Age, BMI) with binary health outcomes like high glucose status.  
This was developed as a skills project to demonstrate Python programming, data cleaning, and data visualization techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Load & clean CSV datasets using pandas
- Modular code with reusable functions (`utils.py`)
- Generate line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots with matplotlib
- Explore relationships between patient metrics (e.g., Age vs Glucose, BMI vs HighGlucose)
- Designed for easy re-use with any similar dataset
